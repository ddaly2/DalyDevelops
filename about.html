        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

          <p>
            I was born in New Jersey and spent the first 21 years of my life
            there. If you have ever watched the ever popular MTV reality TV show
            "The Jersey Shore", I apologize and wish I could give you your time
            back. We are not all like that. My first true exposure to computers
            was when I took computer science in highschool where we learned to
            code in C++. Looking back, creating that tic-tac-toe game was way
            cooler than I thought in the moment.

            During my senior year of highschool, Hurricane Sandy destroyed a
            large portion of the East coast of New Jersey, including the entire
            first floor of my family's home. Perfect timining to apply to
            college... After receiving a few acceptance letters, I decided that
            I would to attend Rutgers University. There, I would go on to study
            economics and gradute with a Bachelor's Degree.

            On my 22nd birthday, I found myself on a plane flying from New
            Jersey on its way to Georgia. I was on my way Fort Benning with very
            little idea of what was in store for me. I enlisted in the Army
            roughly 1 month after graduating from Rutgers. I served in 3rd
            Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment for 4 and a half years. My
            time in service gave me a new found respect for my mental and
            physical capabilities. Along with life long friendships, the Army
            gave me the most formative years of my life.

            About 6 months before I officially transitioned out of the Army, I
            decided that I would pursue a career in IT. I immediately found the
            field of Software Development more interesting. That is when my
            official start to becoming a self-taught Front-end Developer began.
